# This is a basic personnel management system 
that allows you to search, add, delete, and update employee information. Given the scarcity of available routes. As a result, I added the database parameters to it in controller.js.


To Run on your machine

1. Clone the project
2. Launch CMD, cd navigate to the path of the cloned folder, and execute npm install.
3. type the command nodemon server.js.
4. Now open your browser and type the url http://localhost:3000
5. Hit enter

And this is it!
